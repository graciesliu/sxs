                                Each person who experiences illness has a narrative they share with doctors, family and friends, and their communities. (In)visibility explores how health narratives are constructed and communicated through an experiential installation that places visitors “inside” the experience of three people with vision loss.

                            </p>
                            <p>We chose vision loss for its potential to engage visitors viscerally (blindness dramatically affects our sensory experience) and emotionally (more people fear blindness than fear cancer). Vision loss also serves as a point of entry into broader questions: How does illness change the way we “see” ourselves and others? How does our environment shape our health and our bodies?

                            <p>We interviewed patients at the Barnes Jewish Hospital eye clinic, and from these interactions, we identified three core elements of their medical journeys: the sensory experience (loss of vision), the social experience (loss of autonomy and mobility, strained relationships with loved ones and society), and the emotional experience (embracing a new identity as a person with vision loss).

                    <div class="bp bp-left">
                        <p>Using language and imagery from our interviews with patients, we created three fictional characters that visitors follow through these three stages of experience. Diane is a museum curator who works with ancient artifacts and lost her vision suddenly while driving home. Roberto is a hunter who suffered a retinal detachment that was repaired with emergency surgery. And Ella is a mother of four who has experienced progressive vision loss over many years.
                        </p>
                        <p>In each stage of the installation, Diane, Roberto, and Ella describe their experiences in recordings voiced by local actors. Alongside these audio narratives, we modulate physical space by altering light, color, sound quality, and texture. By placing visitors inside the experiences of these characters, we offer them an opportunity to physically inhabit the narratives they are listening to. We hope that (In)visibility enables people to confront and engage with questions of illness, the body, and how we “see” ourselves and others.
