                <p class="lead"> Each person who experiences illness has a narrative they share with their doctors, family and friends, and their local community. Our project explores how these narratives are constructed and communicated in St. Louis, a city where healthcare and lifespan are profoundly influenced by factors such as race, income, and zip code. Through an interactive installation housed at Barnes Jewish Hospital, we aim to highlight illness narratives we collected from individuals in our community, and to create a platform where visitors can share personal stories of their own, creating a dialogue among St. Louisans from all walks of life.</p>

                <h2>If you build it...</h2>
                <p>Our team includes physicians, medical students, artists, architects, engineers, and designers. We interviewed patients at the Barnes Jewish Hospital eye clinic, and from these interactions, identified three core elements of their medical journeys: the sensory experience (loss of vision), the social experience (loss of autonomy and mobility, strained relationships with loved ones and society), and the emotional experience (losing one’s sight and embracing a new identity). Our installation partitions space into three discrete sections, which each represent one of these domains of experience.</p>

                <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
                <p>After completing their journey through the installation, visitors enter a separate space, where they will be invited to record their own stories by answering questions related to the sensory, social, and emotional dimensions of their own health narratives, or those of their loved ones. We envision this as a communal gathering space. Outside of regular installation hours, we will host a series of “StoryCorps”-style events in which local writers and artists gather at the installation site to give readings and performances that engage with questions of illness, the body, and how we “see” ourselves and others. Through this engagement, our installation will continue to evolve, as new stories are shared and experienced by people from throughout our St. Louis community.</p>
